# Moises‚Äôs dotfiles

# Basic guide on installation
## ***WARNING*** **These files might not do what you expect you may want to become a super user and read the install script before doing anything**
## Some things to note
- You may have to change the package manager in .install since this is for Arch Linux
- Some dependecies may not be on your distro/version of linux 
- You may face some errors since, this is not heavily tested

# With that aside let's start installing
## Cloning the repo and sourcing the install script
## Again, make sure you read the install script and change a few things like the package manager used to install the dependencies and packages
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mois-Espinal/my-dotfiles
```
## Then move into the repository and run the following command
```bash
make
```
### And there you go. My dotfiles are installedüòÅ
## **EXTRA**

### Normally on a linux computer I would install the following programs
- ranger
- vlc
## but that is optional
