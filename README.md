# Moisesâ€™s dotfiles

## Basic guide on installation
**WARNING** These files might not do what you expect you may want to become a super user and read the install script before doing anything
### Cloning the repo and sourcing the install script
### Again, make sure you read the install script and change a few things like the package manager used to install the dependencies and packages
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mois-Espinal/my-dotfiles
```
### Then cd into the repository and run the following command
```bash
make Makefile
```
### And there you go. My dotfiles are installed
